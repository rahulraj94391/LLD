/** <h2>Problem</h2>
 * <p>Using the Composite pattern makes sense only when the core model of your app can be represented as a tree.<p/>
 *
 * <p>For example, imagine that you have two types of objects: Products and Boxes. A Box can contain several Products
 * as well as a number of smaller Boxes. These little Boxes can also hold some Products or even smaller Boxes, and so on.<p/>
 *
 * <p>Say you decide to create an ordering system that uses these classes. Orders could contain simple products
 * without any wrapping, as well as boxes stuffed with products...and other boxes. How would you determine the
 * total price of such an order?<p/>
 *
 * <h2>Solution</h2>
 * <p>The Composite pattern suggests that you work with Products and Boxes through a common interface which declares
 * a method for calculating the total price.</p>
 *
 * <p>How would this method work? For a product, it’d simply return the product’s price. For a box, it’d go over each
 * item the box contains, ask its price and then return a total for this box. If one of these items were a smaller box,
 * that box would also start going over its contents and so on, until the prices of all inner components were calculated.
 * A box could even add some extra cost to the final price, such as packaging cost.</p>
 *
 * <p>The greatest benefit of this approach is that you don’t need to care about the concrete classes of objects that
 * compose the tree. You don’t need to know whether an object is a simple product or a sophisticated box. You can treat
 * them all the same via the common interface. When you call a method, the objects themselves pass the request down the tree.<p/>
